NOTE: this should _not_ be used in the constructor when using the automatic domain definition of APIÂ 1,
since in such a case the world origin, domain size and auxiliary grid properties are not defined
until _after_ the constructor is finished.
The method can be called from other member functions (e.g. one of the callbacks).
