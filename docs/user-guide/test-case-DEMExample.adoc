== ++DEMExample++

This is an example showing how to use GPUSPH's support for Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
It loads the topography of the bottom of the domain from a file called `half_wave0.1m.txt`, shipped with GPUSPH.
A different DEM can be used, either by changing the name in the source `src/problems/DEMExample.cu` file,
or by providing the new name as argument to the `--dem`  command-line option to GPUSPH.
