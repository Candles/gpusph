== What is it

This repository holds the source code for {url-proect}[GPUSPH],
the first implementation of weakly-compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH)
to run fully on Graphic Processing Units (GPU), using NVIDIA CUDA.

== Quick start guide

Run `make` followed by `make test` to compile and run the default test problem.
You can see a list of available test problems using `make list-problems`
and run any of them with `make $problem && ./GPUSPH` where `$problem` is the selected problem.

Remember to check the <<docs/installation-guide.adoc#_requirements,Requirements>>,
and consult the <<docs/installation-guide.adoc#,Installation Guide>> for further details
on how to set up and configure your GPUSPH environment.
